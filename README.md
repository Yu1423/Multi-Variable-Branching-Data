# Multi-Varibale-Branching-Data
The generate_instance.cpp is used to generate instances in the paper [Multi-Variable Branching: A 0-1 Knapsack Problem Case Study](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2019/10/7431.pdf) by [Yu Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/yu-yang), Natashia Boland, and Martin Savelsbergh. Compile the source code by "g++ The generate_instance.cpp -std=c++11 -o generator". The compiled executable will generate instances in the folder named "data" in the current directory.
